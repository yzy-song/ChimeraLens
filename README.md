## 💡 Core Concepts

### Monorepo Architecture
The project uses pnpm Workspaces and Turborepo for efficient development and deployment across multiple packages.

### Authentication System
- **Guest Mode**: Device fingerprinting allows instant access without registration
- **Registered Users**: JWT-based authentication with email/password or Google OAuth
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication with automatic refresh

### AI Integration
- **Face Detection**: Client-side MediaPipe for pre-processing and face selection
- **Image Processing**: Automatic cropping and optimization before AI processing
- **Asynchronous Generation**: Polling mechanism for handling long-running AI tasks

### Payment System
- **Credit-based Model**: Users purchase credits to generate images
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure checkout with webhook-based credit fulfillment
- **Guest Credits**: Free trial credits for first-time users
